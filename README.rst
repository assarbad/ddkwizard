License
-------
All projects created by DDKWizard can be put under whatever license you like to
put them. The scripts and HTML files which contain the DDKWizard logic were
subject to the zlib license starting with version 1.2.0. Releases starting 2016
will be licensed under MIT license which is largely equivalent. However, you may
also continue to use it under the terms of the zlib license if that suits you
better. However, in that case I'd like to ask you to open a ticket and let me
know *why* the zlib license is better than the MIT license.

The text for the MIT license can be found in ``LICENSE.txt`` and the zlib
license can be found on here_.

Historic releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NB: prior to version 1.2.0 from 2008 (before the Subversion repository from
which I converted this one even started) the scripts and HTML files which
contain the DDKWizard logic they were released under the GPL version 2 from 1991.
